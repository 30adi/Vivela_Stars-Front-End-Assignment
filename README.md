# Vivela_Stars-Front-End-Assignment
I have built a website, that showcases my Front-End skills. It is a photo gallery having some orientation alike pop-up/modal images.  It is a Responsive Modern Looking website, having acceptance for small and wide screens. Font-awesome is used for icons and Images are scaled using Media queries.  It is made using HTML5, CSS3, JS, and Bootstrap Framework.
